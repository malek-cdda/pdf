                <p>(A) No Association of REALTORS® has set or recommended the term of this contract. Broker/Licensee and
                    Buyer have
                    discussed and agreed </p>
                <p> upon the length or term of this Contract. Broker may be paid a fee that is a
                    percentage of
                    the purchase price. Even though Broker’s Fee, or </p>
                <p> a portion of it, may be paid by seller or listing
                    broker, Broker
                    will continue to represent the interests of Buyer.</p>
                <p>(B) This Contract applies to any property that Buyer chooses to purchase during the term of this
                    Contract. Buyer will
                    not enter into </p>
                <p> a Buyer Agency Contract with another broker/licensee that begins before the Ending Date
                    of this Contract.</p>
                <p>Starting Date: This Contract starts when signed by Buyer and Broker, unless otherwise stated here:
                    <span class="underline">{macros}</span>.

            <h4>BROKER’S FEE</h4>
            <div class="ml-2">
                <p>(A) No Association of REALTORS® has set or recommended the Broker’s fee. Broker and Buyer have
                    negotiated the fee Broker will <br />
                    receive for performing real estate services for Buyer.</p>

                <p>(B) Broker’s Fee, paid by Buyer to Broker, is as follows:</p>
                <p>1. (a) In a purchase transaction with a seller represented by a real estate broker the fee is _____%
                    of the sales price OR <br />
                    $<span class="underline">{macros}</span>, whichever is greater, AND $<span
                        class="underline">{macros}</span>.</p>
                <p>(b) In a purchase transaction with a seller who is not represented by a real estate broker the fee
                    is<span class="underline">{macros}</span>% of the sales price <br />
                    OR $<span class="underline">{macros}</span>, whichever is greater, AND $<span
                        class="underline">{macros}</span>.</p>

                <p>2. Broker’s Fee in event of a lease transaction is: <span class="underline">{macros}</span>.</p>
                <p>3. It is Broker’s policy to accept compensation offered by the listing broker. If the amount received
                    from the listing broker is less <br />
                    than the amount in paragraph 2(B)1, in a purchase transaction, or 2(B)2, in a lease transaction,
                    Buyer<br />
                    will pay Broker the difference, unless seller agrees to pay the difference as a term in the
                    agreement of
                    sale.</p>

                <p>(C) 1. The balance of Broker’s Fee is earned if Buyer enters into an agreement of sale during the
                    term of
                    this Contract, whether <br />
                    brought about by Broker, Broker’s Licensee(s) or by any other person, including Buyer. If Buyer
                    defaults
                    on the terms <br />
                    of an agreement of sale, Broker’s Fee will be paid by Buyer to Broker at that time.
                </p>
                <p>2. If Buyer enters into an agreement of sale for a property after the Ending Date of this Contract,
                    Buyer
                    will pay Broker’s Fee if:</p>
                <p>(a) The agreement of sale is a result of Broker’s actions during the term of this Contract, OR</p>
                <p>(b) The property was seen during the term of this Contract, AND</p>
                <p>(c) Buyer is not under an exclusive buyer agency contract with another broker at the time Buyer
                    enters
                    into an agreement of sale.</p>
                <!-- (D) Buyer is advised that contacting a listing broker or seller directly may compromise Broker’s ability to earn compensation
                    from a listing broker and could result in Buyer’s obligation to pay a fee to Broker. -->

                    the
                    deposit
                    monies may wait to deposit any uncashed check <br />that is provided as deposit money until Seller
                    has
                    accepted
                    an offer.</p>
                <p>(B) Regardless of the apparent entitlement to deposit monies, Pennsylvania law does not allow a
                    Broker
                    holding deposit monies to<br /> determine who is entitled to the deposit monies when settlement does
                    not
                    occur.
                    Broker can only release the deposit monies:</p>
                <p>1. If an agreement of sale is terminated prior to<br /> settlement and there is no dispute over
                    entitlement
                    to
                    the deposit monies. A written agreement signed by both parties<br /> is evidence that there is no
                    dispute
                    regarding deposit monies.</p>
                <p>2. If, after Broker has received deposit monies, Broker receives <br /> a written agreement that is
                    signed
                    by
                    Buyer and Seller,<br /> directing Broker how to distribute some or all of the deposit monies.</p>
                <p>3. According to the terms of a final order of court.</p>
                <p>4. According to the terms of a prior written agreement between Buyer and Seller that directs the
                    Broker<br />
                    how to distribute the deposit monies if there is a dispute between the parties that is not resolved.
                </p>
                <p>(C) Buyer agrees that if Buyer names Broker or Broker’s licensee(s) in litigation regarding deposit
                    monies,<br />
                    the attorneys’ fees and costs of the Broker(s) and licensee(s) will be paid by Buyer.</p>
