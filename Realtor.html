            <p>

            <p> <span class="underline">{macros}</span>% of the gross purchase price of the property acquired by Buyer;

            <p>above through services of Broker or otherwise, or the material conditions of such contract are

            <p>6. <span class="bold"> DUAL/DESIGNATED AGENTS:</span>
                Broker is authorized to receive the compensation offered by the Listing Firm to a buyer’s broker or paid
                by a
            </p>
            <p>certain properties listed by Broker may be of interest to Buyer. Buyer authorizes Broker to bring to
                Buyer’s attention any properties</p>
            <p>listed by Broker which may suit Buyer’s needs and hereby instructs Broker to inform Buyer at the time of
                its representation of the</p>
            <p>seller. If Buyer elects to view or consider property listed by Broker and to make an offer on such
                property, then dual agency by the</p>
            <p>Broker will exist, and Broker must either obtain the written consent of Buyer and Broker’s seller client
                to: (i) assign different</p>
            <p>licensees of Broker as designated agents to represent Buyer and seller; or (b) act as a dual agent for
                Buyer and seller in the same</p>
            <p>transaction. Under Virginia law, designated agents shall not be considered dual agents and shall not be
                limited in their ability to</p>
            <p>represent the client to whom they are designated in the transaction. The principal or supervising broker
                who is supervising the</p>
            <p>transaction is considered a dual agent of both Buyer and seller, and such broker’s ability to represent
                both clients will be limited.</p>
            <p>Broker shall not disclose to either client or such client’s designated agent any information that has
                been given to Broker by the other </p>
            <p>client within the confidence and trust of the brokerage relationship, unless the disclosure is required
                by law or consented to in .</p>
            <p>writing by the affected party. In dual agency, there is a limitation on Broker’s ability to represent
                either Buyer or seller fully and</p>
            <p> exclusively. Paragraph 7 of this Agreement contains a disclosure explaining more fully the roles and
                responsibilities of Buyer, a </p>
            <p>seller and the agent in a dual agency. Broker shall request Buyer’s consent to act as a dual agent if
                Buyer desires to make an offer</p>
            <p> on a property listed by Broker and Buyer agrees that before making an offer</p>
            <p> on any property listed by Broker, Buyer will enter into a written consent to a dual agency on the part
                of Broker</p>

            <p>7. <span class="bold"> DISCLOSURE REGARDING DUAL AGENCY: </span>
                If Buyer is shown a property listed by Broker and/or makes an offer on such
            </p>
            <p>property, and Broker has not designated agents to represent Buyer and the seller, Broker and all of
                Broker’s licensees will be acting</p>
            <p>as the agent for both the seller and Buyer in the transaction. In such a transaction, Broker will remain
                impartial to the seller and</p>
            <p>Buyer. Buyer agrees that Broker shall not be liable to either party for refusing or failing to disclose
                information which, in the sole</p>
            <p>discretion of Broker, would harm one party’s bargaining position and would benefit the other party.
                Broker cannot disclose or advise</p>
            <p>either Buyer or seller as to (i) the terms to offer or accept in any offer or counteroffer; (ii) the
                suitability of the property, its condition</p>
            <p>(other than to make any disclosures as required by law of any licensee representing a seller), or the
                repairs to make or request; or</p>
            <p>(iii) any dispute that arises relating to the transaction. If the seller and Buyer do not enter into an
                agreement for the purchase of the</p>
            <p>seller’s property, such dual agency shall terminate. Buyer acknowledges the implications of Broker’s dual
                agency, including the</p>
            <p>limitation on Broker’s ability to represent the seller or Buyer fully and exclusively. Buyer understands
                that Buyer may seek</p>
            <p>independent legal counsel or engage another real estate licensee at Buyer’s sole expense in order to
                assist with any matter relating</p>
            <p>to a purchase agreement or to the transaction that is the subject matter of a purchase agreement. If
                Buyer engages legal counsel</p>
            <p>and/or another real estate licensee, Broker shall: (i) continue to act as a dual agent with the consent
                of Buyer; or (ii) terminate</p>
            <p>Broker’s representation of Buyer by written notice to Buyer only with respect to the property listed by
                Broker in which Buyer has</p>
            <p>made an offer, but in either choice of (i) or (ii) above, Broker shall be entitled to the Fee set forth
                in Paragraph 5 unless otherwise</p>
            <p>agreed to by Broker. Provided Broker has acted in accordance with its obligations under this Agreement,
                Broker shall not be liable</p>
            <p>for any claims, damages, losses, expenses or liabilities arising from Broker’s role as dual agent. Buyer
                shall have a duty to protect</p>
            <p>its own interests and should read any purchase agreement carefully to insure that it accurately sets
                forth terms Buyer wants</p>
            <p>ncluded in the purchase agreement. If acting as a dual agent, Broker will: treat the seller and Buyer
                honestly; disclose material facts</p>
            <p>about the property that are known to Broker as required by law; assist in the preparation of the purchase
                agreement; work diligently</p>
            <p>to facilitate the sale and work with the seller and Buyer’s settlement agent/attorney to facilitate
                closing. Broker may also assist Buyer</p>
            <p>to arrange property inspections, help Buyer compare financing alternatives, and provide information about
                comparable properties so</p>
            <p>the seller and Buyer may make an educated decision about the price to be contained in the purchase
